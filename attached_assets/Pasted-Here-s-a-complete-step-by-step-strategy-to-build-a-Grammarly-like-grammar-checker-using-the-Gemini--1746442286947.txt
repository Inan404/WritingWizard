Here's a complete, step-by-step strategy to build a Grammarly-like grammar checker using the Gemini API, with:

🔍 Detection of grammar issues

🛠 Fix suggestions with explanations

🔁 Context-aware revalidation

💡 Optional: Inline suggestions for UI

🧑‍💻 Backend logic to prevent redundant/conflicting fixes

✅ Project Structure Overview
Frontend (React or other):

Input box (textarea)

Highlight suggestions

Accept/Reject individual fixes

Backend (Node.js/Python):

Sends text to Gemini API

Receives structured suggestions + corrected text

Applies one fix at a time and revalidates

🔧 Gemini Prompt Design
📦 Prompt Template (for structured suggestions):
text
Copy
Edit
You are a grammar and writing assistant. Analyze the text and return:

1. A list of grammar issues with:
   - original phrase
   - corrected version
   - brief explanation
   - character position (start and end index)

2. The fully corrected version of the text.

Return your answer as a JSON object.

Text:
"""
He don't like go to school. They goes home early everyday.
"""
✅ Expected Gemini Response:
json
Copy
Edit
{
  "issues": [
    {
      "original": "He don't",
      "correction": "He doesn't",
      "explanation": "Subject-verb agreement",
      "start": 0,
      "end": 8
    },
    {
      "original": "like go to school",
      "correction": "like going to school",
      "explanation": "Gerund required after 'like'",
      "start": 9,
      "end": 27
    },
    {
      "original": "They goes",
      "correction": "They go",
      "explanation": "Plural subject needs base verb form",
      "start": 29,
      "end": 39
    },
    {
      "original": "everyday",
      "correction": "every day",
      "explanation": "'Everyday' is an adjective, not used correctly here",
      "start": 55,
      "end": 63
    }
  ],
  "correctedText": "He doesn't like going to school. They go home early every day."
}
🔄 Context-Aware Fix Application Logic
Step-by-Step Flow:
Send raw text to Gemini with the prompt above.

Sort suggestions by start index (to avoid offset issues when applying).

Apply the first suggestion to the original text.

Send updated text back to Gemini to re-analyze.

Repeat for the next issue only if it still applies (check if original still exists at the same index).

Store a list of applied suggestions, discarded ones, and possibly introduce a manual override for UI.

🧠 Optional Features You Can Build:
✅ Inline Highlighting (Frontend)
Store suggestions with character start/end and render spans with highlights and tooltips:

html
Copy
Edit
<span class="highlight" data-tooltip="Correction: They go">They goes</span>
✅ Accept/Reject UI
When user accepts:

Replace the text using the suggestion

Call backend to re-run validation and update

🧑‍💻 Example Code (Node.js Gemini API)
ts
Copy
Edit
import { GoogleGenerativeAI } from "@google/generative-ai";

const genAI = new GoogleGenerativeAI(process.env.GEMINI_API_KEY);
const model = genAI.getGenerativeModel({ model: "gemini-pro" });

export async function getGrammarSuggestions(text) {
  const prompt = `You are a grammar checker... [full prompt from above with "${text}"]`;

  const result = await model.generateContent({
    contents: [{ role: "user", parts: [{ text: prompt }] }],
    generationConfig: {
      temperature: 0.3,
      topK: 20,
      topP: 0.9,
      maxOutputTokens: 1024,
    },
  });

  const raw = await result.response.text();
  const json = JSON.parse(raw); // try/catch to handle parsing errors
  return json;
}
⚠️ Gotchas & Tips
Always re-validate after applying a change.

Be careful with offset shifting after a fix — easiest solution: re-request Gemini’s suggestions after each fix.

Use low temperature (0.3) to keep grammar corrections stable and accurate.

For very long texts, break into paragraphs/sentences before processing to avoid token limit issues.

🧩 Optional Add-ons
Spell check with: "Also fix any spelling mistakes"

Style suggestions (e.g., passive → active)

ESL (English as Second Language) mode: simplify complex grammar

Batch correction preview + “Apply All” feature
