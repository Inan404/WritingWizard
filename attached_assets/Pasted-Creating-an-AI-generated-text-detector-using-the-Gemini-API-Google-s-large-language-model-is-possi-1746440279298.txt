Creating an AI-generated text detector using the Gemini API (Google's large language model) is possible, though Gemini isn't specifically trained to detect AI content. However, you can build a reliable soft detector by designing prompts that leverage Gemini's understanding of text patterns, style, and metadata.

✅ Step-by-Step: Build an AI Detector Using Gemini API
1. Get Access to Gemini API
Sign up at Google AI Studio or use it through Vertex AI on GCP.

Use a Gemini model like gemini-pro via REST API or SDK (Node.js, Python, etc.).

2. Strategy: Prompt Gemini to Analyze the Text
Use zero-shot or few-shot prompting to make Gemini assess whether a piece of text "feels" AI-generated or not, based on tone, structure, and fluency patterns.

3. Sample Prompt (Zero-Shot Detection)
text
Copy
Edit
You are a writing style analyst. Given a piece of text, determine whether it is likely to be written by a human or generated by an AI.

Text:
"""
The evolution of digital intelligence marks a pivotal shift in the trajectory of human innovation...
"""

Please analyze the tone, structure, vocabulary, and flow. Is this more likely to be written by an AI or a human? Justify your answer with specific clues.
You can also add:

“Use casual reasoning.”

“Mention red flags that hint at AI authorship (e.g., excessive formality, balanced phrasing, unnatural transitions).”

4. Sample Gemini Response Format
json
Copy
Edit
{
  "verdict": "AI-generated",
  "confidence": 0.84,
  "reasons": [
    "Overly formal tone",
    "Perfectly balanced sentence structures",
    "No contractions or informal expressions"
  ]
}
You can parse this response and assign thresholds (e.g., confidence > 0.7) to flag content as AI-written.

5. Optional: Few-Shot Prompting for More Accuracy
Add 2–3 labeled examples of human vs AI text first, like:

python
Copy
Edit
Example 1:
Text: "Honestly, I didn’t expect AI to be so involved in daily life..."
Label: Human

Example 2:
Text: "The advancement of artificial intelligence continues to redefine the modern world..."
Label: AI

Now analyze the following:
"""
[Your input text here]
"""
Label:
✅ 6. Code Skeleton (Node.js example)
ts
Copy
Edit
const { GoogleGenerativeAI } = require("@google/generative-ai");

const genAI = new GoogleGenerativeAI("YOUR_API_KEY");

async function detectAI(text) {
  const model = genAI.getGenerativeModel({ model: "gemini-pro" });

  const prompt = `
You are a detector that determines whether a text is written by an AI or a human.
Text:
"""
${text}
"""
Is this likely AI or human-written? Explain briefly and return a confidence score (0 to 1).
  `;

  const result = await model.generateContent(prompt);
  const output = await result.response.text();
  console.log(output);
}

detectAI("Paste user text here");
✅ Limitations
Gemini is not 100% accurate — it's better used as a soft stylistic detector, not forensic.

Pairing with a statistical classifier (e.g., based on perplexity, burstiness, or n-gram variation) can increase accuracy.
