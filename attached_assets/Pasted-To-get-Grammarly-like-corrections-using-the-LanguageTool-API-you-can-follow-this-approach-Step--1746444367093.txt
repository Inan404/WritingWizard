To get Grammarly-like corrections using the LanguageTool API, you can follow this approach:

‚úÖ Step-by-step Strategy
Send a POST request to the LanguageTool API (either the free public API or self-hosted one).

Extract matches from the response.

For each match:

Check the replacements field.

Replace the text at the offset and length with the first suggestion (or ask the user to choose).

Re-run the corrected text through the API again to ensure no overlapping or outdated suggestions remain (Grammarly-like step).

üß† Example Input:
text
Copy
Edit
"She don't like going to school because the teachers gives too much homeworks and nobody help her with it."
üõ†Ô∏è Sample Request (in Python)
python
Copy
Edit
import requests

text = "She don't like going to school because the teachers gives too much homeworks and nobody help her with it."

response = requests.post(
    'https://api.languagetoolplus.com/v2/check',
    data={
        'text': text,
        'language': 'en-US',
    }
)

matches = response.json()["matches"]

# Apply replacements (basic strategy: use the first suggestion)
corrected_text = text
offset_shift = 0

for match in matches:
    if match["replacements"]:
        offset = match["offset"] + offset_shift
        length = match["length"]
        replacement = match["replacements"][0]["value"]

        # Replace in the text
        corrected_text = (
            corrected_text[:offset] +
            replacement +
            corrected_text[offset + length:]
        )
        
        # Adjust offset shift
        offset_shift += len(replacement) - length

print("Corrected Text:\n", corrected_text)
üí° Output Example:
text
Copy
Edit
"She doesn't like going to school because the teachers give too much homework and nobody helps her with it."
üîÅ For Grammarly-like Flow
Repeat the request after correction to catch new suggestions caused by earlier fixes.

üìå Bonus Tips:
You can show multiple suggestions with explanation: match['message'], match['shortMessage'], match['replacements']

Grammarly sometimes groups multiple edits and evaluates flow/style‚ÄîLanguageTool is rule-based, so combine it with text embeddings or GPT models for better style rewrites.
