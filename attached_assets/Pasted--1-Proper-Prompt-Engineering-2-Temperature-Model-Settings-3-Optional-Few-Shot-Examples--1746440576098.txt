ðŸ”§ 1. Gemini Prompt Template (For Humanizing Text)
Use this prompt:

text
Copy
Edit
You are a writing assistant that rewrites AI-generated text to sound like a real human wrote it.

Your task:
- Make the text sound informal, like someone casually reflecting or explaining an idea.
- Break up long sentences.
- Use contractions (Iâ€™m, donâ€™t, itâ€™s).
- Include slight hesitation, filler words (like, kind of, maybe), and small personal touches.
- Vary sentence lengths. Donâ€™t make it too clean or academic.
- Avoid sounding robotic or too balanced. Make it natural and conversational.

Hereâ€™s the text to humanize:
"""
[Insert AI-generated text here]
"""
Return only the rewritten version.
ðŸ”¥ 2. Model Settings for Gemini API
Use these recommended values for natural, human-like variation:

Setting	Value	Description
temperature	0.9	High randomness = more human-like creativity
top_k	40	Narrows word choices slightly, still diverse
top_p	0.95	Keeps natural variability, limits outlier tokens
max_tokens	512+	Adjust depending on how long your input text is

âœ… 3. Optional Few-Shot Prompting (for More Accuracy)
Add examples like:

python
Copy
Edit
Example:
Input: Artificial intelligence is transforming the way we live and work. Its influence extends to...
Output: AI is kind of everywhere these days. Itâ€™s changing how we live, work, even how we think...

Now do the same for this text:
"""
[YOUR TEXT]
"""
You can keep up to 2â€“3 examples for better results.

ðŸš€ Sample Gemini API Call (Node.js)
ts
Copy
Edit
import { GoogleGenerativeAI } from "@google/generative-ai";
const genAI = new GoogleGenerativeAI(process.env.GEMINI_API_KEY);

async function humanizeText(aiText) {
  const model = genAI.getGenerativeModel({ model: "gemini-pro" });

  const prompt = `You are a writing assistant that rewrites... [insert full prompt above with aiText]`;

  const result = await model.generateContent({
    contents: [{ role: "user", parts: [{ text: prompt }] }],
    generationConfig: {
      temperature: 0.9,
      topK: 40,
      topP: 0.95,
      maxOutputTokens: 512,
    },
  });

  const response = await result.response.text();
  return response;
}
âœ… Pro Tip for Extra Stealth
You can post-process the Gemini output by:

Inserting a few typos or casual grammar flaws

Slightly paraphrasing the first and last sentence

Adding a personal memory or observation ("I remember when...")
