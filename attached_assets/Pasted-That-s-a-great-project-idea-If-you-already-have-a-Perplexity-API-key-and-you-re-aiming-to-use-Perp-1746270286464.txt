That's a great project idea! If you already have a Perplexity API key, and you're aiming to use Perplexity Sonar (which is their advanced LLM, similar to GPT-4), here‚Äôs a clear roadmap to integrate it into your EdTech site with features like grammar checking, AI detection, text humanization, and chatbot interactions.

üîß STEP 1: Understand Perplexity API Capabilities
As of now, Perplexity API primarily provides access to their Sonar LLMs (text generation models) and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) capabilities.

So using Sonar, you can:

Generate text

Rewrite content (for humanization or grammar)

Act as a chatbot

Process and analyze input

But Perplexity does not currently provide a specialized AI-detector like GPTZero or ZeroGPT, so you may need to use another tool for AI detection.

‚úÖ STEP 2: Core Features You Want
Here‚Äôs how you can implement each feature:

1. Grammar Check (like Grammarly)
Prompt Engineering + Sonar API
Send a prompt like:

text
Copy
Edit
Check this paragraph for grammar, spelling, and clarity issues. Return the corrected version and a brief explanation of the changes.

Text: "He go to school every day but he not like it."
Example API usage (Python):

python
Copy
Edit
import requests

headers = {
    "Authorization": "Bearer YOUR_API_KEY",
    "Content-Type": "application/json"
}

payload = {
    "model": "sonar-small-chat",  # or sonar-medium, etc.
    "messages": [
        {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful grammar assistant."},
        {"role": "user", "content": "Check this for grammar: He go to school every day but he not like it."}
    ]
}

response = requests.post("https://api.perplexity.ai/chat/completions", headers=headers, json=payload)
print(response.json())
2. AI Check (detect if text is AI-generated)
‚ö†Ô∏è Perplexity Sonar doesn‚Äôt natively detect AI-generated text.

Alternative:

Use GPTZero API, Sapling AI detector, or OpenAI‚Äôs AI detection endpoint.

Optionally, use linguistic heuristics (e.g., burstiness, perplexity) but accuracy may be limited.

3. Text Humanizer
Send prompt like:

text
Copy
Edit
Make this AI-generated text sound more natural and human, as if written by a high school student: 
"Modern technology has revolutionized the way we communicate with each other."
You can adjust tone/style level in your prompt:

"Make it informal"

"Make it sound like a student from Bangladesh"

"Add some humor" ‚Äî etc.

4. Chatbot (Tutoring or General Chat)
Create a persistent chat interface using the messages array to maintain history, just like OpenAI chat APIs.

Example:

json
Copy
Edit
"messages": [
  {"role": "system", "content": "You are an education assistant helping students prepare for IBA admission."},
  {"role": "user", "content": "Give me a shortcut for math percentage problems."}
]
üîå STEP 3: Build Your Backend (Node.js / Python / etc.)
Use a backend to securely store your API key and handle requests:

Accept input from front-end (text)

Process it with Perplexity API

Return results to front-end (formatted nicely)

üé® STEP 4: Front-End Integration
If you're using:

React/Vue ‚Üí Set up a clean interface with tabs for Grammar, AI check, Humanizer, and Chatbot.

Tailwind or Bootstrap ‚Üí For quick and responsive UI

Add loading spinners, copy buttons, and response cards.

üß† BONUS: AI Check (Alternative Services)
Since Perplexity doesn‚Äôt support AI detection natively, try integrating:

GPTZero

Sapling AI

Originality.ai ‚Äî Paid

These have APIs you can connect to separately.

üì¶ Final Tech Stack Suggestion
Frontend: React + Tailwind

Backend: Node.js or Python (FastAPI)

LLM: Perplexity Sonar API

AI Detector: GPTZero or other

Database (optional): Firebase or Supabase

Deployment: Vercel/Netlify for frontend, Render/Heroku for backend
