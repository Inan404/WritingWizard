# WebSocket to HTTP Migration

## Changes Made

### Server-side Changes
1. Removed WebSocket handler functions:
   - handleChatMessage
   - handleGrammarCheck
   - handleParaphrase
   - handleHumanize
   - handleAiCheck

2. Added HTTP endpoints for all AI functionality:
   - `/api/ai/process` - Unified endpoint for processing AI requests
   - `/api/grammar-check`
   - `/api/paraphrase`
   - `/api/humanize`
   - `/api/ai-check`
   - `/api/chat-generate`

3. Removed WebSocket server initialization from routes.ts
4. Fixed logging in AI check handler to use text length instead of result.aiAnalyzed.length

### Client-side Changes
1. Unused WebSocket related hooks:
   - useAiWebSocket.ts - No longer in use
   - useWebSocket.ts - No longer in use

2. Components now use HTTP API calls via the useAiTool hook which:
   - Implements request de-duplication
   - Provides caching for similar requests
   - Handles errors consistently
   - Returns strongly-typed responses

## Rationale
The migration from WebSockets to HTTP-only approach was done to:

1. Improve performance by avoiding the overhead of WebSocket connections
2. Simplify the architecture by removing bidirectional communication when it wasn't needed
3. Better error handling with HTTP status codes
4. More predictable resource usage without persistent connections
5. Easier debugging with standard HTTP request/response cycle

## Result
All components now use direct HTTP API calls instead of WebSocket connections. The application should be more responsive and stable with this change.
